        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity is not about fear or complexity.
          It is about understanding how attacks actually happen
          and preparing people and systems accordingly.
        </p>

        <h2>Human & Technical Security</h2>
        <p>
          We focus on both sides of security:
          human behavior and technical infrastructure.
          Most breaches start with people — not code.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>Responsibility & Trust</h2>
        <p>
          Every action we take is guided by ethics,
          transparency and clear authorization.
          Trust is not claimed — it is earned.

      <p>
        Security is a continuous process — not a one-time solution.
